1. Information We Collect
PunBot collects minimal information to function effectively. The types of data we may collect include:

a. User Messages:

What we collect: Messages you send to interact with PunBot (like commands or prompts).
Why we collect it: To generate joke responses, assist with replies, or execute commands.
How long we keep it: We do not store message content unless explicitly stated. Messages are processed in real-time and discarded immediately after the response is sent.
b. User Identifiers:

What we collect: Your Discord user ID, server ID, and channel ID.
Why we collect it: To identify the user or server where commands are executed and provide contextual responses.
How long we keep it: These identifiers are not stored permanently. They are processed temporarily for the duration of the command's execution.
c. Logs and Analytics (Optional):

What we collect: Non-personally identifiable logs (like command usage statistics).
Why we collect it: To improve bot performance, detect issues, and enhance the user experience.
How long we keep it: Logs may be stored for a limited period for debugging purposes.
2. How We Use Your Information
We use the information we collect in the following ways:

To provide core bot functionality, such as responding to jokes and assistance requests.
To improve user experience, such as by optimizing bot responses and performance.
To ensure security and prevent abuse, such as by detecting and responding to potential misuse of the bot.
We do NOT sell, rent, or trade your information with any third parties.

3. How We Store and Protect Your Information
Storage: PunBot does not store personal information like messages or user identifiers long-term. Any information temporarily processed is deleted once the task is complete.
Security: We use industry-standard security practices to protect your data. Access to any stored logs is strictly limited.
Data Retention: Message content is not retained. Identifiers are only kept during the active session of the command execution.
4. Sharing Your Information
We do not share your information with third parties, except when required by law or in response to a valid legal request.

5. Your Rights and Choices

Access your data: Request access to the data we collect.
Delete your data: Request the deletion of your data.
Restrict processing: Restrict how your data is processed.
